## Project
Using computer vision techniques, this project aims to analyze plasma images and predict plasma ignition and process conditions such as delivered radio frequency power and process gas types.

The plasma emits light, and the brightness and color of this light vary depending on the process conditions. By analyzing these images, we can detect plasma ignition and predict the current process conditions.

### Task 1: Plasma Detection
The model can classify plasma images as either **ignited** or **not ignited**. This model can be used as a plasma detection sensor.

### Task 2: Process Condition Prediction
The brightness and color of the plasma light depend on the process conditions. By training a convolutional neural networks model on a dataset of plasma images, we can predict the current process conditions
